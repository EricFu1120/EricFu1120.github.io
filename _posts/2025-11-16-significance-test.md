# What Statistical Test Should I Do?

**Reference:** [What statistical test should I do?](https://statsandr.com/blog/what-statistical-test-should-i-do/) from Stats and R

## A Question You Must Ask Yourself in Your Research Career

I am definitely that student in Antoine Soetewey's blog post, "What statistical test should I do?" Even after working many years in the industry, I still had not asked myself this question—until I worked on an LLM-as-a-Judge project last year.

That's when I realized I could no longer bear such an annoying problem. It was time to ask myself this question and answer it every single time. I know it seems ridiculous for a senior researcher to not know how to choose the right statistical test, but for me, I take it as paying a knowledge debt to my past self.

## Why I Strongly Recommend This Blog

When I was searching Google for the answer to this question, I discovered that Antoine Soetewey had already created a structured flowchart (as you can see in the above-mentioned post). I'm grateful for his work in summarizing such dense content that I had hoped to create myself someday.

The blog offers:
- **Clear decision-making framework**: A prepared instruction set you can follow
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Almost every statistical test with detailed explanations
- **LLM-friendly format**: In the era of large language models, the flowchart serves as an excellent reference document that can be used with ChatGPT for your specific tasks
